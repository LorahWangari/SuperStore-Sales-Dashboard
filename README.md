# SuperStore-Sales-Dashboard

This time, I analyzed sales performance for a fictional retail store, digging deep into gender trends, sales categories, and time-based patterns.

Highlights from the dashboard:
🔹 Sales distribution by Gender, Category, and Segment
🔹 Monthly and Daily Sales Trends
🔹 Data-driven visuals to uncover high-performing periods and products

🛠 Tools used:
Power BI | Data Cleaning | Relationship Modeling | Visual Best Practices

💡 This project helped sharpen my analytical eye and practice turning raw data into business insights. The biggest takeaway? 📉 October showed a surprising sales peak—time to dig into the “why”! 😄
